## PDF Question Answering System Using NLP

### Introduction
With the proliferation of digital documents, efficiently extracting relevant information from PDFs is a significant challenge. This project aims to develop an intelligent system that can answer user queries based on the content of PDF documents. Leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and pre-trained models, we sought to create an accurate and user-friendly solution.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a system capable of understanding and responding to user questions by extracting pertinent information from PDF files. Our goal was to ensure high accuracy and relevance in the answers provided, thereby enhancing the usability of digital documents.

### Approach
Our approach involved several key steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - We used the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) for initial model training. This dataset contains a vast number of question-answer pairs based on Wikipedia articles.
   - For preprocessing, we extracted text from PDF files using the PyMuPDF library. This step included removing stop words and tokenizing the text to ensure better model performance.

2. **Model Selection and Fine-Tuning:**
   - We began by experimenting with word embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe. However, these methods did not provide the required contextual understanding.
   - We then moved to transformer-based models, specifically BERT. These models were fine-tuned on our dataset to improve their question-answering capabilities.

3. **Interface Development:**
   - To make the system accessible, we developed a web interface using Gradio. This interface allows users to upload a PDF and type their questions, making the interaction straightforward and user-friendly.

### Results
Our fine-tuned BERT model showed significant improvements in accuracy, achieving an accuracy rate of 85% on our test queries. We observed consistent performance across various types of questions, evidenced by precision and recall metrics. Visualizations of these metrics demonstrated the clear benefits of fine-tuning and advanced preprocessing.

### Discussion
The results underline the importance of contextual embeddings in NLP tasks. Pre-trained model like BERT, when fine-tuned, excel in understanding and processing complex queries. The preprocessing steps, including stop word removal and tokenization, played a crucial role in enhancing model performance. The insights gained from this project highlight the effectiveness of transformer-based models for question-answering tasks.

### Conclusion
We successfully developed a PDF question-answering system that accurately extracts answers from PDF content. Fine-tuning pre-trained models and implementing advanced preprocessing techniques were key to our success. Future improvements could include integrating more diverse datasets for training, enhancing the user interface, and exploring other NLP models like GPT-3 for potentially better results.
